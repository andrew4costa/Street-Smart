# Street-Smart Kaggle Project

This project was a part of Kaggle competition.

The competition entailed predicting the rent prices for homes based on certain variables contained within the dataset. Within this implementation, I used a linear regression and an XGBoost model.

I chose to evaluate the models using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to account for large errors in the predictions. What I discovered was that the linear regression model outperformed the XGBoost model in this instance.
